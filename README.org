As per the official email, we have three deliverables:

*** DONE 1. Explain the Dot1L plots
  CLOSED: [2020-07-23 Do 15:58]

  These turned out to be a plot of cell count distributions, which was virtually unreadable before. I have since updated it to more meaningful metrics. [[file:1_plots.org][Notebook is here]].

*** DONE 2. Append CRE recombinase expression to cells
  CLOSED: [2020-07-27 Mo 15:58]
  
  Galaxy was used to map the cell reads against the transcriptome of the CRE transcript; two were used, one from NCBI and one from AddGene. The NCBI matrices detected CRE expression only in the K matrices, which was good. 141 cells were annotated to the metadata matrix that adrian provided. [[file:2_cre.org][Notebook is here]].


*** DOING 3. Perform WCGNA analysis

  Working on it.
